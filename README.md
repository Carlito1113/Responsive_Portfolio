# Responsive_Portfolio
This is a first-portfolio project which heavily utilizes bootstrap.

The languages used in this project are HTML5, CSS, and mostly bootstrap-contained Javascript.

It is comprised of an index.html, portfolio.html, contact.html, and style.css file.

It has an "About Me" (contained in the index.html file) page which contains a placeholder image for future use as well as two paragraphs containing some information about me.

The second and next page is the "Portfolio" page (contained in portfolio.html) which lists 5 placeholder images that will be utilized in the future to display my completed projects.

The third and final page is the "Contact" page which is located in the contact.html file and contains a form with name, email, and comment boxes, as well as a submit button.
